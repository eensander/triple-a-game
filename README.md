# Triple A game

Initially, the objective of this school-project was to create a processing-application which would display exploding particles, kind of similair to, but much simpler than [this android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunglab.tripleafree). This is also what the name is derived from.

Throughout the development, it seemed the objective was easily achieved and hence ships with opponents got introduced giving this little project a gameplay.
